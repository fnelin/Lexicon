You have been provided with some raw HTML, basic CSS, and images — now you need to create a layout for the design.

The tasks you need to achieve are:

Display the navigation items in a row, with an equal amount of space between the items and a smaller amount of space at either end of the row.

Style the navigation bar so it scrolls with the content normally but then becomes stuck at the top of the viewport when it reaches it.

Cause the "feature" image inside the article to have text wrapped around it to the right and bottom, with a suitable amount of space between the image and the text.

Display the <article> and <aside> elements as a two-column layout, with the former three times as wide as the latter. The columns should be a flexible size so that if the browser window gets narrower, the columns become narrower. Include a 20-pixel gap between the two columns.

The photographs should display as a two-column grid with equal-sized columns and a 5-pixel gap between the images.

Hints:
-You don't need to edit the HTML to complete this challenge.
-There are a few ways to achieve some of the tasks in the project brief, and there often isn't a single right or wrong way to do things. Try a few different approaches and see what works best. Make notes as you experiment.
